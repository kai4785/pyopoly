Rent is calculated differently for nearly all properties.
Normal Properties have:
    a) Base rent value
    b) Double base if both of 2 conditions are met:
        i) All property group is owned
        ii) Property is unupgraded (no houses purchased)
    c) Updated each time the property is upgraded (a house/hotel is purchased)
    d) A maximum number of 5 houses (equals a hotel)
Utilties (Electric, water)
    a) If 1 is owned
        i) times 4
    b) If both are owned
        i) times 10
Railroads
    a) Base $25 rent
    b) Doubled for each railroad owned (25 * 2^<number owned>)
